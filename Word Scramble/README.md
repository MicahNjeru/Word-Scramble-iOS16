#  Word Scramble iOS 16
This is an app that runs on iOS 16 created by following 100 days of swift by Paul Hudson aka twostraws!

## Features
1. Let's you come up with a word from a randomly prompted word at the title
2. The user should then come up with a word that uses more than 1 letter of that word that isn't that provided word
3. It also records the words the user has gotten correctly and displays the number of letters of each accepted word
4. The user cannot use words already on the list to as entries
5. Used words are populated in reverse order of entry to have the most recent word at the top to improve UX.

## Key take aways / What I've learnt
1. Swift still relies on some Objective-C functionalities  
2. Swift is very efficient in storing and retrieving app assets from the app bundle
3. Making iOS apps using Swift is starting to feel very fluid and fun!
